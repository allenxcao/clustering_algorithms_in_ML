# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning
This project provides an in-depth review of 8 clustering algorithms commonly used in machine learning. It includes intuitive mathematical explanations for each algorithm and demonstrates their implementation with scratch Python code and simple examples.

Clustering Algorithms Covered
1. K-Means Clustering
2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
3. GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)
4. BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering Using Hierarchies)
5. Affinity Propagation Clustering
6. Mean-Shift Clustering
7. OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure)
8. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
